# MPS-Pharmaceuticals-Drug-Planning

Overview
This project demonstrates advanced business analytics skills through a comprehensive analysis of the drug launch strategy for Sequacor by MPS Pharmaceuticals. The analysis covers demand forecasting, production capacity optimization, financial viability assessment, and strategic decision-making over a 20-year period.

Key Components

1. Demand Forecasting
- Objective: Predict Sequacor's demand over 20 years
- Methodology: Exponential smoothing based on historical data of Propalor
- Key Insight: Forecasted 7.5% higher demand compared to Propalor

2. Production Capacity Optimization
- Objective: Determine optimal annual production capacity
- Tools Used: Excel Solver, Scenario Analysis
- Key Finding: Optimal production capacity of 33,201 units annually

3. Financial Analysis
- Objective: Assess project viability under different discount rates
- Methods: NPV and IRR calculations at 5%, 7.5%, and 10% discount rates
- Recommendation: 7.5% discount rate for balanced risk-reward

4. Outsourcing vs. In-House Production Analysis
- Objective: Compare outsourcing and in-house manufacturing options
- Tools Used: NPV comparison, Excel Solver for cost negotiation
- Key Insight: Hybrid approach recommended, with negotiable outsourcing cost of Â£2.98 per unit

5. Project Management and Timeline
- Objective: Estimate facility construction timeline
- Method: PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
- Result: 227 days estimated completion time, 57% probability of meeting 40-week deadline

Skills Demonstrated
- Time Series Forecasting
- Linear Programming and Optimization
- Financial Modelling (NPV, IRR calculations)
- Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis
- Decision Analysis
- Project Management Techniques (PERT)
- Strategic Business Planning

Key Findings and Recommendations
1. Forecasted demand shows consistent year-over-year increase
2. Optimal production capacity balances efficiency and market demand
3. 7.5% discount rate recommended for financial planning
4. Hybrid approach of initial outsourcing with phased in-house production development
5. Phased production approach for scalability and risk management
6. Rigorous project management with 10-month timeline for facility establishment

Tools and Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel (Advanced features: Solver, Scenario Manager, Data Tables)
- Exponential Smoothing for Forecasting
- PERT for Project Management

Strategic Implications
- The analysis provides a framework for informed decision-making in drug launch strategies
- Emphasizes the importance of balancing immediate market entry with long-term strategic advantages
- Highlights the need for flexibility and scalability in pharmaceutical production planning

This project showcases the application of advanced analytical techniques to a complex pharmaceutical business problem, demonstrating proficiency in data-driven decision-making, strategic analysis, and comprehensive business planning.
